    1. Matplotlib -> Basic and powerful plotting
    2. Seaborn -> Statistical plots built on Matplotlib
    3. Plotly -> Interactive, web-based visualizations
    4. Pandas (plot) -> Quick plots from DataFrames
    5. Bokeh -> Interactive visuizations, well suited for large datasets and web-based
                applications
