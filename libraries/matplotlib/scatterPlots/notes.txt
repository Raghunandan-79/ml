Used mostly in machine learning for clustering

Problem: Suppose you are analyzing a students data
x axis = hours studied
y axis = exam scores

We need to find relations
more study = more marks
more marks = less scores

To solve above Problem we use scatter plot which will represt each data 
point with a dot in the graph

A scatterplot is a graph where each point represent one observation with 
two values

Where it is used ?
    1. Find the correlation between two variables
    2. It is used in machine learning in regression

    'o' -> circle
    's' -> square
    '^' -> upward triangle
    'D' -> diamond
    'x' -> cross
    '+' -> plus sign
