Before creating matplotlib in early 2000s there was a problem how can we create
graphs and charts using python. People have to use matlab but it was expensive, 
paid and difficult. They needed two things:
    1. Simple syntax
    2. Python

John D. Hunter, A neurobiologist the author of Matplotlib. He was working on a 
brain image data. There he needed high quality images but he have to use matlab
there were many laptop and he found a solution that he should make a library
which can:
    1. Plot graphs
    2. Free and open source.

What is Matplotlib ?
A python library using which we can
    1. Line graphs -> find trend overtime
    2. Bar chart -> compare different groups
    3. Pie chart -> show parts of a whole
    4. Histogram -> frequency or distribution
    5. Scatter plot -> find relationship between two points
    6. Custom graphics

How to install ?
    1. pip3 install matplotlib
    2. uv pip install matplotlib

Importing:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
matplotlib -> main package
pyplot -> plots
